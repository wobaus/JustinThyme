The Elevator Pitch: It's a web app for people who want to know when to plant their seeds. It's useful for novice and intermediate growers alike. The novice user can use it to discover what seeds to grow in their region, and the intermediate user can use it to keep track of all the seeds they're storing away like squirrels.

Brief:
The aims of this website is to notify users of when to plant some seeds, just in time! It also aims to provide users information regarding when to plant certain seeds, and to give suggestions on which seeds to plant if they don't know where to start in the process. The target audience for this website is those that want to be reminded of when to plant seeds. They could be a beginner grower who doesn't really know which seeds to plant, to an intermediate grower who wants to keep track of their seeds on hand, and be reminded of when to grow them. This website is for people with access to gardening spaces, whether it be at their own home and at a community plot. The amount of space needed is varied for different seeds and is not within the scope of this website to provide that information. The target audience, demographically, is varied in age... A very young to a very old person with access to the internet could access the website. If they have the text notifications enabled, they're within the age range of a cell phone user. The target audience can access the site via phones, tablets, or desktops... But without access to a cell phone, one cannot utilize the benefit of the notifications available from the website. The look of the site feels green and naturey; the feel is excitement for growing something to eat for yourself and you are anticipating the grow season... It'll have a little splash page with a quick ditty of how to utilize the web app.
